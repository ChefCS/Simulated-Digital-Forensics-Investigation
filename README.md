# Simulated-Digital-Forensics-Investigation

 ### [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project showcases a comprehensive digital forensic investigation workflow using Volatility3, Autopsy, and FTK Imager. By leveraging publicly available memory dumps and disk images, the project simulates real-world cyber incidents such as ransomware infections, rootkit deployment, and data exfiltration. The goal is to identify artifacts, analyze evidence, and produce a detailed forensic report.
<br></br>


<h2>Objectives</h2>

- Simulate real-world forensic investigations using memory dumps and disk images.
- Demonstrate forensic techniques with Volatility3, Autopsy, and FTK Imager.
- Establish a workflow for memory analysis, disk imaging, and artifact recovery.
- Enhance incident response skills by identifying and analyzing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Produce a professional forensic report documenting findings and recommendations.
<br></br>

<h2>Tools used</h2>

- <b>Volatility3:</b> Memory analysis to extract artifacts from RAM dumps.
- <b>Autopsy:</b> Open-source forensic platform for disk and file system analysis.
- <b>FTK Imager:</b> Forensic imaging tool to create, verify, and extract data from disk images.
